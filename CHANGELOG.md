Summoning Tweaks Changelog
=======
# Summoning Tweaks 1.1.0.0
* Added a "Tiny Demon's Codex", available from the Commands submenu in the Summoning Tweaks settings menu.
	* Use this book to learn "Copy Infusions" and "Apply Infusions", which can be used to copy/apply incarnate infusions outside of battle.
	* Copied infusions are "remembered" and can be used to apply the same infusions to your incarnates quickly in bulk.
	* Associated skills for copied infusions must be memorized for them to be applied once more.

# Summoning Tweaks 1.0.2.0
* Minor quick fixes:
	* Fix for the host flag not being set when opening the ST menu via the mod menu.
	* Fix for the summon cap not being raised when summoning a Bloated Corpse (normally when you cast a summon spell, an invisible status is applied (+ stacked) that raises your max summoning limit. Bloated Corpse is a target spell, so it was ignored by the check).

# Summoning Tweaks 1.0.1.0
* Reworked code for adding "Dismiss Summon", so it's added when you summon any creature now, instead of solely when you cast a summon skill.
* Settings Menu
	* Added an option to disable auto-adding the Dismiss Summon skill and Summoner's Contract.
	* Commands
		* Added a Add/Remove Dismiss Summon Commands
