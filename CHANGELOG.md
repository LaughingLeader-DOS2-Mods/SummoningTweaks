Summoning Tweaks Changelog
=======
# 1.0.2.0
* Minor quick fixes:
	* Fix for the host flag not being set when opening the ST menu via the mod menu.
	* Fix for the summon cap not being raised when summoning a Bloated Corpse (normally when you cast a summon spell, an invisible status is applied (+ stacked) that raises your max summoning limit. Bloated Corpse is a target spell, so it was ignored by the check).

# 1.0.1.0
* Reworked code for adding "Dismiss Summon", so it's added when you summon any creature now, instead of solely when you cast a summon skill.
* Settings Menu
	* Added an option to disable auto-adding the Dismiss Summon skill and Summoner's Contract.
	* Commands
		* Added a Add/Remove Dismiss Summon Commands

# 1.0.0.4
* Moved permanent summons to a separate mod, made Bloated Corpse permanent.

# 1.0.0.0
* Initial Release
